    <div class="subtitle">Description</div>
    <div class="description"> This project is a experimentation with coding and reinterpretating the concept of book in the space of the internet. It is a book made of screenshots on google maps, and the mechanic behind the book is that the images will be randomly collaged and changed once the user blinks. I think this is a interesting concept to play with people's nature of blinking, and how it somehow frustrates or amazes the user when the image changes according to their blinking patterns. I also want to play with the idea of memory a little bit, and chose the images from familiar places.</div>
