    <div class="description">I was still really interested in the concept of blinkng and reading that I came up with last week. This time, I merged different photos that I found online to create these symbolic and surreal scenes. The mechanics is similar to the previous one, but I made some little renderings. For the first 40 blinks, there will be only one single image changing on the screen. Until the 140 blinks, the images will be randomly cropped and collaged. From the 140 to 210 blink, the images will become increasingly blurry until they are fully abstract. Overall, I want to reverse the usual experience of reading a little bit in this project and create a different flow of reading. </div>
