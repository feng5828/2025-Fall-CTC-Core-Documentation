    <div class="description">This final project combined my earlier experimentatioin of materials and forms. Since we were not allowed to use image tracing this time, I combined abstract forms that I made in cuttle with adobe illustrator to create those abstract forms. This time, I was also manually changing the brush pens as the printing process went by, and this intervention created the merging of colors and bleeding effects that I really enjoyed.</div>
