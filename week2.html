    <div class="subtitle">Description</div>
    <div class="description">This week's project continued and expanded my experimentation with materials from last week. I found that brush pens create interesting bleeding and blurring effects on rice paper, so I did the whole project based on this. For the vectors, they come from images that are over-rendered and actracted so that the vectors did not have recognizable forms anymore. I also did some tryouts on the bigger paper and was changing the brush pen and dipping the pen into water as the printing process went by -- I am interested in the results but it was really time-consuming.  </div>
